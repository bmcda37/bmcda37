I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems with a concentration in Cybersecurity from the University of Georgia. Currently, I'm working towards a Master's degree in Cybersecurity at Augusta University, aiming to deepen my comprehension of topics covered in lectures and self-guided labs. My objective is to investigate innovative methods for leveraging technology to enhance the security of our systems. In my free time, I dedicate myself to expanding my expertise in our field and familiarizing myself with new tools to add to my skill set as I strive toward becoming a versatile cybersecurity professional.

## Objective

My journey in information systems and eagerness to protect others has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity. I plan to use the skills developed in undergrad, along with my professional work experience, to continue growing my competencies within Digital Forensics, Threat Hunting, Vulnerability & Patch Management, Programming, and Networking to become a well-rounded cybersecurity professional. I plan to showcase any skills I learn within my Github page demonstrating my eagerness for continual learning in this field.
